    I am a selftaught Frontend Developer with a degree in Business and Finance. 
    Having both technical and business skills puts me in a unique position.
    I started my first business as a 10 years old and ever since i fell in love with the idea of being an entrepreneur. 
    This is why i chose to position my self the way i did. I've always had interest for technology and thus it makes more sense to get a business education and take the self taught route into tech.
